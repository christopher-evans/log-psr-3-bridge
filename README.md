## Autoloading

This package is [PSR-4][] autoloadable via composer or otherwise mapping the `West\Log`
namespace to the `src/` directory.  To run the tests the `West\Log` namespace should map
to the `tests/` directory.


## Dependencies

This package requires PHP 7.0 or later; interfaces required by the package are
documented in the [composer.json][] file.


## Code Quality

To run the unit tests and generate a coverage report with [PHPUnit][] run
`composer install` followed by `composer test` at the command line.

This package should comply with the recommendations set out in [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][]
and [PSR-4][].

To run the benchmarks and generate a report with [PHPBench][] run `composer install`
followed by `composer benchmark` at the command line.  For details about the
reports see the the [composer.json][] file and the [PHPBenchDocs][].


## Documentation

This package is documented [here](./docs/index.md).  To generate the docs run
run `composer install --no-dev`, ensure [Doxygen][] is installed and available
as `doxygen` and run `composer docs`.


## Principles

The aim of this package is to implement some of the principles of object oriented programming
described in David West's [Object Thinking][].  Many of the ideas
come from [Yegor Bugayenko][]'s distillations of West's book, and [Alan Kay][]'s comments on [Squeak][]
and [Smalltalk][].  In particular:

- Everything is an object.

  _Some exceptions are permitted, for example the introduction of resources, in part to compensate
  for the lack of OOP in earlier versions of the language, are allowed._

- An object exists in real life.

- Objects interact through interfaces.

  _Objects judge objects based on what they do, not what they are.  A public method not documented by an interface would
  be redundant._

- An object is unique.

  _Some exceptions are permitted, for example two objects encapsulating distinct URIs may point to the same resource
  without aggressive [URI normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_normalization)._

- An object is immutable.

  _Various definitions of immutability can be contended, e.g. a file object representing a file in a mutable filesystem
  is considered mutable regardless of whether an changes to the file are visible through the object._

- A class name does not end in '-er'.

  _An object is a thing, and a class name described what objects of that class are, not what they do. Verbs are used for
  method names._

- There are no `null` values.

  _The special value `null` is not an instance of any class, and does not implement any (useful) interface. An object
  that does not implement the interfaces expected of it's fellow class members does not exist.  One exception is
  permitted: PHP only allows null to be used as the default value for an argument type-hinted as a class; in this case
  a null default value may be used.  This allows multiple method signatures without duplicating code._

- A class does not have any static properties or methods.

  _An application consists of objects interacting through interfaces, and classes are used to describe sets of objects, not
  to implement logic for those objects._

- A class is either abstract or final. Only abstract methods are protected.

  _An object manages it's own internal behavior, and works with other objects only through it's public interface.
  Extending a 'completed' class may break the logic of the parent class. Abstract classes themselves are normally
  avoided._

- No getters and setters.

  _Objects are defined bey their behavior, not by their attributes.  Getters and setters are a shallow way of imitating
  data-based design as if it were a behavior of an object._
